# 8012-Assessment
My second Java project during my MSc. This project is a simple command-line library app used to track withdrawn books and library users passed in from a txt file.

The librarian can attach a txt file to be read which includes a list of books (title and author) and a list of users. Each book and user is an object and users can take out books and return books within certain parameters.
The programme allows for multiple books with the same name. The books and users are automatically sorted into alphabetical order when added to the array list.
